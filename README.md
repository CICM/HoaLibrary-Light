#### A high order ambisonics library.

Sound space is one of the principal dimensions of the contemporary musical thought, specialy in the electroacoustic music domain but also in intermedia arts. In this context, the [CICM](http://cicm.mshparisnord.org/ "CICM") has made spatialization its principal research axis. This project's aim is to give to musician spatialization models based on high order ambisonics and sound fields synthesis. This project is developed in a part of the Paris 8 University [LABEX arts H2H](http://www.labex-arts-h2h.fr/ "LABEX arts H2H").
